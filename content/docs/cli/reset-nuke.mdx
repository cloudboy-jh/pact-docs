# pact reset & nuke

Commands for cleaning up your Pact installation.

## pact reset

Remove all symlinks created by Pact, but keep the `.pact/` directory.

```bash
pact reset
```

### What it Does

1. Reads your `pact.json` configuration
2. Finds all targets that were symlinked
3. Removes the symlinks

### When to Use

- You want to temporarily disable Pact-managed configs
- You're switching to a different configuration system
- You need to test something with default configs

### Example

```bash
$ pact reset

Removing symlinks...
  ✓ Removed ~/.zshrc
  ✓ Removed ~/.config/nvim
  ✓ Removed ~/.gitconfig

3 symlinks removed
```


After reset, you can restore everything with `pact sync`.


---
## pact nuke

Complete removal of Pact from your system.

```bash
pact nuke [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `-f, --force` | bool | Skip confirmation prompt |

### What it Does

1. Removes all symlinks (like `pact reset`)
2. Deletes the `.pact/` directory
3. Removes your GitHub token from keychain

### Warning


`pact nuke` is destructive! It removes:
- All symlinked configs
- Your local `.pact/` clone
- Your GitHub token

Your `my-pact` repo on GitHub is **not** affected.


### Example

```bash
$ pact nuke

⚠️  This will:
  • Remove all symlinks
  • Delete .pact/ directory
  • Remove GitHub token from keychain

Your my-pact repo on GitHub will NOT be deleted.

Are you sure? (y/N): y

Removing symlinks...
  ✓ Removed ~/.zshrc
  ✓ Removed ~/.config/nvim

Deleting .pact/...
  ✓ Removed .pact/

Removing token from keychain...
  ✓ Token removed

✓ Pact removed from this machine
```

### Force mode

Skip the confirmation:

```bash
pact nuke --force
```

or

```bash
pact nuke -f
```

## Recovery After Nuke

If you accidentally ran `pact nuke`, recovery is easy:

```bash
# Re-initialize (will re-authenticate and clone your repo)
pact init

# Re-apply all configs
pact sync
```

Your configurations are safe on GitHub — `nuke` only affects the local machine.

## Comparison

| Action | reset | nuke |
|--------|-------|------|
| Remove symlinks | ✓ | ✓ |
| Delete .pact/ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Remove token | ✗ | ✓ |
| Recoverable with `pact sync` | ✓ | ✗ (need `pact init`) |

## Use Cases

### Testing default configs

```bash
pact reset
# Test with system defaults
pact sync  # Restore pact configs
```

### Moving to a new project

```bash
cd old-project
pact reset
cd ../new-project
pact init
pact sync
```

### Complete fresh start

```bash
pact nuke -f
pact init
pact sync
```

### Switching GitHub accounts

```bash
pact nuke
# Log in with new GitHub account
pact init
```

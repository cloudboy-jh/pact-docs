title: pact init
description: Initialize Pact and authenticate with GitHub
---

Authenticate with GitHub and set up your pact repository.

## Usage

```bash
pact init [flags]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--from` | string | Fork pact from another user (not yet implemented) |

## How It Works

`pact init` creates a `.pact/` folder in your **current directory**. That's it.

```bash
pact init    # Creates .pact/ wherever you are
```

Where you run the command determines where your config lives:

```bash
# Global config (available everywhere)
cd ~
pact init              # Creates ~/.pact/

# Project-specific config
cd ~/projects/my-app
pact init              # Creates ~/projects/my-app/.pact/
```

## Directory Resolution

Pact finds your `.pact/` directory using git-like tree walking:

1. Checks the current directory for `.pact/`
2. Walks up the directory tree checking each parent
3. Falls back to `~/.pact/` if nothing is found

This means subdirectories automatically inherit their parent's pact config:

```
~/projects/my-app/
├── .pact/                    # pact init was run here
├── src/
│   └── components/           # pact commands work here too
└── tests/                    # and here
```

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app/src/components
pact sync    # Finds and uses ~/projects/my-app/.pact/
```

## What it Does

### 1. Check for existing pact

Looks for `.pact/` in the current directory tree. Exits if already initialized.

### 2. Authenticate with GitHub

Checks for an existing token in your OS keychain. If none exists, starts the GitHub Device Flow:

```txt
Opening browser for GitHub authentication...
Enter code: ABCD-1234 at https://github.com/login/device
Waiting for authorization...
```

### 3. Verify/Create Repository

Checks if `{username}/my-pact` repo exists on GitHub. If not, creates it automatically.

### 4. Clone to Local

Clones the repo to `./.pact/` in your current directory.

### 5. Create Default Config

If no `pact.json` exists, creates one with this template:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "user": "your-username",
  "modules": {
    "shell": {},
    "editor": {},
    "git": {},
    "ai": {
      "providers": {},
      "prompts": {},
      "agents": {}
    },
    "tools": {
      "configs": {}
    }
  },
  "secrets": []
}
```

## Examples

### First Time Setup

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/my-app
$ pact init

Opening browser for GitHub authentication...
Enter code: ABCD-1234 at https://github.com/login/device

Waiting for authorization...
✓ Authenticated as cloudboy-jh

Checking for existing pact repo...
✓ Found cloudboy-jh/my-pact

Cloning to ./.pact/...
✓ Cloned successfully

✓ Pact initialized!

Run 'pact sync' to apply your configurations.
```

### On a New Machine

When running `pact init` on a machine where you've already authenticated:

```bash
$ pact init

Found existing token in keychain.
✓ Authenticated as cloudboy-jh

Cloning cloudboy-jh/my-pact to ./.pact/...
✓ Cloned successfully

✓ Pact initialized!
```

### Global vs Project Config

```bash
# For configs you want everywhere
cd ~
pact init
pact sync

# For project-specific configs
cd ~/projects/client-work
pact init
pact sync
```

Both use the same `my-pact` GitHub repo — the difference is just where the local `.pact/` clone lives.

## Token Storage

The GitHub token is stored in your OS keychain:

| OS | Storage |
|----|---------|
| macOS | Keychain |
| Linux | libsecret / gnome-keyring |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager |


The token is stored globally, so you only need to authenticate once per machine, regardless of how many projects use pact.


## Troubleshooting

### "pact already initialized"

Pact found an existing `.pact/` directory. If you want to start fresh:

```bash
pact nuke
pact init
```

### Authentication timeout

The device flow code expires after 15 minutes. If it times out, just run `pact init` again.

### Permission denied

Make sure you have write access to the current directory and that the `my-pact` repo exists or you have permission to create it.

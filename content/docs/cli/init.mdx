description: Initialize Pact and authenticate with GitHub
---

Authenticate with GitHub and set up your pact repository.

## Usage

```bash
pact init [flags]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--from` | string | Fork pact from another user (not yet implemented) |

## What it Does

### 1. Check for existing pact

Looks for `.pact/` in the current directory tree. Exits if already initialized.

### 2. Authenticate with GitHub

Checks for an existing token in your OS keychain. If none exists, starts the GitHub Device Flow:

```txt
Opening browser for GitHub authentication...
Enter code: ABCD-1234 at https://github.com/login/device
Waiting for authorization...
```

### 3. Verify/Create Repository

Checks if `{username}/my-pact` repo exists on GitHub. If not, creates it automatically.

### 4. Clone to Local

Clones the repo to `./.pact/` in your current directory.

### 5. Create Default Config

If no `pact.json` exists, creates one with this template:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "user": "your-username",
  "modules": {
    "shell": {},
    "editor": {},
    "git": {},
    "ai": {
      "providers": {},
      "prompts": {},
      "agents": {}
    },
    "tools": {
      "configs": {}
    }
  },
  "secrets": []
}
```

## Example

```bash
$ cd my-project
$ pact init

Opening browser for GitHub authentication...
Enter code: ABCD-1234 at https://github.com/login/device

Waiting for authorization...
✓ Authenticated as cloudboy-jh

Checking for existing pact repo...
✓ Found cloudboy-jh/my-pact

Cloning to ./.pact/...
✓ Cloned successfully

✓ Pact initialized!

Run 'pact sync' to apply your configurations.
```

## On a New Machine

When running `pact init` on a machine where you've already set up pact:

```bash
$ pact init

Found existing token in keychain.
✓ Authenticated as cloudboy-jh

Cloning cloudboy-jh/my-pact to ./.pact/...
✓ Cloned successfully

✓ Pact initialized!
```

Your existing configurations are immediately available.

## Token Storage

The GitHub token is stored in your OS keychain:

| OS | Storage |
|----|---------|
| macOS | Keychain |
| Linux | libsecret / gnome-keyring |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager |


The token is stored globally, so you only need to authenticate once per machine, regardless of how many projects use pact.


## Troubleshooting

### "pact already initialized"

Pact found an existing `.pact/` directory. If you want to start fresh:

```bash
pact nuke
pact init
```

### Authentication timeout

The device flow code expires after 15 minutes. If it times out, just run `pact init` again.

### Permission denied

Make sure you have write access to the current directory and that the `my-pact` repo exists or you have permission to create it.
